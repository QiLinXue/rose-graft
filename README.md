# Testing for Rose Graft Consistency
## Installation Instructions
### Installation Via GIT
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.
1. `git clone https://github.com/QiLinXue/rose-graft.git`
2. `cd rose-graft`

### Manual Installation
Feel free to manually copy the file. Make sure that you have a folder called `grafts/` and that you are in the right directory such that Python can access the folder.

## Running the Program
Make sure you have Python 3.
1. Install dependancies. TKinter should come with Python. To install numpy (if you don't have it already), type in `pip install numpy`
2. Put in the graft photos in the `grafts/` folder and number it as `graft1.jpg`, `graft2.jpg`, etc.
3. Run `python graft_test.py.` A screen should come up. Follow the instructions printed in the output terminal.
